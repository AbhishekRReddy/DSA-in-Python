Dynamic Programming
The word dynamic basically comes from the problem solving appraoch where one needs to 
find the best decisions one after another.   

Problems with Optimal Substructure and Overlapping Problem can be solved with DP.
Optimal Substructure - By Combining the optimal solution of sub-problems, the solution to Overall problem can be 
obtained.Overlapping Problem - If we are solving the same sub-problems again and aagin through recursion then these
subproblems are Overlapping. Such problems can be solved.

We can solve DP problems with two approaches viz.,
1. Memoization- Top-Down approach - Store the values and use it if the same sub-problem arises in future.
2. Tabular method - Bottom-Up appraoch - Start from the smaller problem and use that solution to solve slightly bigger problem,unitll the final solution is reached.
