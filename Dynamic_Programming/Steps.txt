Recursion steps
1. Express the problem in terms of the indices.
2. Do all the possible ways.
3. Take the minimum/maximum for the optimation problems.

Dynamic Programming- Memoization - Bottom Up approach. 

1. Look at the paramters changing.
2. Use the dp list/dictionary to store before returning the value.
3. Check after the base condition that whether do we have a solution stored in list/dictionary or not.

Dynamic Programming- Tabular method - Top Down approach
1. Intialise the dp array.
2. Store the base case in the dp array.
3. Compute the value of current element with the previous two values.
